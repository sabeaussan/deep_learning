# Deep learning

## Repository with Pytorch/Keras/numpy implementation of multiple machine learning algorithm

# Currently :

Supervised Learning :

  - Implementation of ResNet34 and ResNet18 + model trained on cifar-10
    linked : article https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf
    
  - Implementation of a convulutionnal neural network with numpy
  
  #TODO : 
    - Add ResNe50 and +
    - Add parallel computation for convolution (numpy)
    - Add BatchNormalization layer and transpose convolution (numpy)
